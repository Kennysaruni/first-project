# first-project
This is my final Phase 1 project
It is a simple currency converter app and i learnt more methods of styling and DOM manipulation by research though quite challenging art first
It is limited to a few currencies but with time ill add onto them
My app is a one page app using a public currency converter API called Frankfurter
I have used HTML,CSS and javaScript to build my currency converter app
